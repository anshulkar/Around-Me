A simple android app for my blog www.amangoeliitb.blogspot.com
I own a blog in which I write about competitive examinations and how to prepare for them.
This android app helps the viewers to see the blog in their smartphone without using the browser.
It uses an SQLite database to save the articles for offline viewing.
The app uses Google's RSS feed API to fetch articles from the blog.
